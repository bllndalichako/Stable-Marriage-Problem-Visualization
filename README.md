# Stable Marriage Visualizer

The Gale-Shapley algorithm is very straightforward, so this didn't take me that long to make. There are probably a few bugs.

## Why React?

React is an interesting framework. Working with pure state is very powerful but forces you to think in a particular way --- that the visual of your program is a function of the execution state (an object) of your program. So everything has to represented as a discrete state. This lends itself well to an algoritm like GS.

## Features to add

- More functionality (Being able to move back a day in execution)
- More visuals (Think crossing out rejected proposers, examine each player's details, adding headshots for each player)
